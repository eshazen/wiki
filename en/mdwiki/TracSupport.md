# Trac Support

Like in most [open source projects](http://www.opensource.org/), Trac support is available primarily through the [trac:MailingList mailing list] and the [trac: project wiki]. Both are maintained by the trac community. The [trac: project wiki] is the authoritative source for the TracGuide, consisting of the administrator and user guides for Trac.

There is an [trac:IrcChannel IRC channel] where online users can help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.

You can search questions tagged with `trac` on [SO:tagged/trac Stack Overflow].

Before you start a new support query, make sure you have done the appropriate searching:
 * in the project's [trac:TracFaq FAQ]
 * in past messages to the [Trac Users Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users)
 * in the Trac ticket system, using either a [trac:search:?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on full search] or a [trac:query: ticket query].

Please *don't* create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org to ask a Trac support question. Only use it when you face a _real_ and _new_ bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the [trac:NewTicketGuidelines NewTicketGuidelines]. The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or implemented promptly!

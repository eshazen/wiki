# DanAgendaMuonWeekOct2018


ATLAS:
 * Muon week [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/671182/)
 * FELIX:  Email *today* please to try to set up meeting with *Giovanna* or one of the other folks about FELIX for phase 2 (ref [email](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/ATLAS/misc/FELIX_TTC_in_ATLAS.txt))
   * Giovanna said we can mix tx/rx links in whatever numbers we want.
   * The FELIX stream is set by us.  She said different groups want different and differently sized data and that we provide the FW block that passes on the TTC info we want.
 * Meet briefly with *Philippe Farthouat* (ATLAS electronics coordinator) and maybe show him 1 or 2 slides on the blade plan.  Let him know you will attend the Friday board brainstorming meeting.
 * Michigan guys:  Say hello to  *Junjie Zhu* or *Tom Schwartz* from Michigan please talk with them about the CSM FPGA vs LpGBT plans


CMS:

 * See *Magnus Hansen* (CMS Elx coordinator) and fill him in on Blade design/progress (maybe with Jeroen)
 * See *Jeroen Hegeman* (near Magnus' office)
   * Pick up prototype new AMC13 to bring home for testing
   * Ask for update on new TTC/TTC plans for CMS
 * See *Greg Iles* (office next to Magnus) and/or *Mark Pesaresi* (Serenity guys)
 * Visit *Attila Racz* and/or *Domique Gigi* in the CMS DAQ group

Misc:

 * Meet *Julian Mendez* for updates on IPMC and LpGBT-FPGA.
 * Visit ProtoDUNE

To steal from Magnus:

 * HDMI to SMA breakout:  <img src="http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/CMS/HDMI_SMA.jpg">

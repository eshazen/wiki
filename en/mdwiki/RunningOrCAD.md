# RunningOrCAD


OrCAD is available from ENG.  Obtaining the distribution requires logging on to
*\\engnas.bu.edu\support*.  In *software\windows\i386\cadence*.
Or contact Eric to see if there is a copy lying about you can pick up.

The license information can be found [here](http://collaborate.bu.edu/engit/SoftwareLicensing) (essentially, use *!5280@CadenceLM.bu.edu* for
the license location).

OrCAD training materials require a cadence support subscription, but here are a couple
of useful links:

 * Capture tutorial from UMBC:  [here](http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~cpatel2/links/310/projects/capture_cis.pdf) or [local](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/Papers/capture_cis.pdf).
 * OrCAD Flow Turorial (15.7 but still relevant):  [here](http://www.umel.feec.vutbr.cz/~prasek/OrCAD15-7DemoTutorial.pdf) or [local](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/Papers/OrCAD15-7DemoTutorial.pdf).
 * User's Guide: [here](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~jan/spice/PSpice_CaptureGuideOrCAD.pdf)

Do not install 17.2 Lite.  OrCAD 16.6 is currently the version we use (as of Oct 2018).  You can find this in the SPB folder.

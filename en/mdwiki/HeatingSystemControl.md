## Ideas 2020

New high-efficiency boiler installed Sept 2020.  Thinking about a proper control system.
Features:

 * Big easy-to-use control panel with backlit color screen (touch screen)?
  (so maybe R-Pi with touch screen)
 * Sensor(s) in living area
 * Sensor(s) in basement on pipes
 * Sensor(s) on upstairs radiators

Ideally some sensor mesh network so can deploy small battery-powered wireless sensors.

# LinuxCluster
See [main website](http://joule.bu.edu/~hazen/LinuxCluster/)

To move the 2nd cluster to 4th floor lab we need the following:

 * 220V AC power plug (one is missing) &ndash; Hubbell HBL2711
   * $50 from Newark
   * [Cheaper here](http://www.espelectrical.com/PROD_HBL2711.html)
 * 10/4 power cable (already have it)
 * USB DAQ interface for temperature sensors ($107 from Labjack)
 * Temperature sensors and wire (negligible cost, but need some technician work).

The server can read the temperature periodically and send alarm e-mails
or shut down both clusters in an emergency (if the temp goes i.e. above 35 or 40
degrees C.

# AMC13ProductionT1Problem
Our latest run of T1XG boards omitted a slot which is needed for installation of the front panel hardware.
See photo:  http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/AMC13/2020Fab/T1XG_PCB_NO_SLOT.jpg

We ordered the boards from these Gerbers:

 * T1: http://gauss.bu.edu/svn/amc13-hardware/AMC13XG/Gerbers/T1XG/T1XG_0.3.zip
 * T2: http://gauss.bu.edu/svn/amc13-hardware/AMC13XG/Gerbers/T2New2FLASH/T2New2019.zip
 * T3: http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/CMS/AMC13/Rev1/T3/BU_AMC13_T3_Rev2.zip
   * http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/CMS/AMC13/Rev1/T3/T3.xls

While Shouxiang claims these are the latest:

 * T1: http://physics.bu.edu/~wusx/download/AMC13XG/T1XG_Dec6.zip

The files are definitely different, and the "0.3" zip file does not contain key file "T1XG-!RoundHoles.TXT" and "T1XG-!SlotHoles.TXT" but only "T1XG.DRL" which is a binary file.

This page is dedicated to analyzing how to keep costs low by Designing For Manufacturing (DFM).

### Definitions

 * Annular Rings
   * The donut ("annulus") created when your drill pierces a copper layer. It is defined as the radius of this donut. For example, a .030" pad with an .020" hole would have a .005" annular ring
 * Finished Hole Size (Plated Through Holes)
   * Size of through hole AFTER plating
   * Plated all the way through the board
   * Plated Through Holes are normally drilled 4-6 mils over nominal finished hole size. Copper and solder plating generally reduces hole diameter by ~3-5 mils
 * Unfinished Hole Size (Non-Plated Through Holes)
   * Size of through hole directly after drilling, BEFORE plating
 * Aspect Ratio
   * Board thickness divided by smallest drilled hole (via's).
   * HIGHER aspect ratios (bigger board thickness, smaller hole) increases probability for voids in holes.


 * Further Understanding of terminology with *pictures*
   * Sunstone Circuits has a great page [here](http://www.sunstone.com/pcb-capabilities/pcb-manufacturing-capabilities) that has fantastic pictures illustrating what is what in terms of lingo.

## Specs to Minimize Fabrication and Assembly Costs

*Note:* This list is very conservative, and if followed you should be able to send your design to any manufacturer, assembly house, etc. and get their lowest price possible.

### PCB Shape

 * *PCBâ€™s must have 2 parallel sides (preferably the 2 longest sides)* for  process through most automated assembly equipment.
 * Breakaway rails and/or panelization can be used to accommodate a wide variety of odd board shapes.

### Board Layer Count & Construction

 * *Even number of layers.*
 * Odd number of layers lead to warpage problems.
 * Layer stackup should be symmetrical with regard to dielectrics, copper weights, and layer design. Asymmetrical designs are a primary cause of warped boards.

### Copper Weights / Trace Widths / Trace Spacings

 * Trace line/spacing
   * *7/7 mils minimum*
   * This is for most common copper weights, like .5oz, 1oz,2oz. For higher weights you will need larger width/spacing.
 * Copper Weights
   * *less CU weight is cheapest.* Such as .5oz for inner layers and 1oz for outer layers
  *Go as light as possible and still have good current handeling.

### Drill
http://www.atechcircuit.com/pcb-capability/rigid-pcb
 * Hole Size* * Annular Rings
   * *For cheapest price across all companies, go >=15mils* if you can. This includes vias.
 * Annular Rings
   * *7mil minimum*
 * Aspect Ratio
   * *No higher than 6:1*
 * Hole Tolerances
   * Plated Through Holes
     * 6 mil window is ideal (+/- 3 mils)
     * If PTHs over 100 mils are located at the edges of the board, they should have large outer layer pads to prevent too fast plating.
       * *Pads 200 mils larger than the hole*
   * Non-Plated Through Holes
     * 4 mil window

# RF_Phase_Shifter
This is a small circuit which we built to shift the phase of
a 30-100Mhz sine wave by about 0-90 degrees for an ECE
research group.

This board was mounted in a small Bud box (2-1/8 x 2-3/4 x 1-5/8),
with 1/2 inch holes for the SMA connectors.  The PCB should was mounted on standoffs.

A DB-9 male connector was mounted in the box for power.

The DB-9 pinout is as follows:

```
  pin 1 - +5V
  pin 3 - GND
  pin 5 - -5V

```

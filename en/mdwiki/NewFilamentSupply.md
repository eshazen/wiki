This is a power supply for the electron gun filament.

This will be implemented as a new PCB following closely the
original design, and mounted in an appropriate enclosure.

A 120/240V jumper will need to be provided for the AC input.

The ammeter should be a digital panel meter.  With the 0.1 ohm
current sense resistor, the output would be 0.1V/A so a 3-1/2 digit
meter with the decimal point set appropriately would be fine.

### Enclosure

The 2N3773 transistor (TO-204) needs a very big heatsink and should be mounted
outside the case as in the original.

PCB is 6 x 6 in.  Transformer sits about 1.6 in high on PCB.

     * Maybe not high enough

Not finding many off-the-shelf box options.

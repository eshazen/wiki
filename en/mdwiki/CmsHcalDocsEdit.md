# CmsHcalDocsEdit
Useful email from R. Kellogg on 11/12/18:

Dear HCAL Documenters,

Since afs is soon going our of service, I have migrated the HCAL documentation site:
/afs/cern.ch/cms/HCAL/document (http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/HCAL/document/)
to:

/eos/project/c/cmsweb/www/hcaldocs/document (http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/HCALdocs/document/)

I have added you to the eGroup cms-eos-web-hcaldocs, which should grant you write and delete privileges to this eos directory.  Please give it a try.

I will be doing some reorganization of the site, since HCAL developments have long-since outgrown its original structure.  I hope you will not get lost when making changes.

eos is mounted directly on lxplus, and can also be synched to your local machine via cernbox.  I have managed to make all this work, and I hope you will be able to as well.  Perhaps you can get some hints from my log:
http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/HCALdocs/document/904/log/logbook_2018.txt
starting on 06-nov-2018, although our exact circumstances are bound to differ.

Yours,  Dick

New version of drawing presented ([PDF](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/Ahlen_Neutron/Proto1/Prototype1_overall_2010-10-19.pdf)

Dave described his proposed wiring scheme, involving a rotating drum driven by a lathe, calibrated
to advance 5mm per rotation.  The drum would have two bars screwed to it, to which the wires
would be glued after the required number of turns are wound.

The wire between the bars would be cut, and the bars with attached set of wires removed and placed in a fixture.

A frame would be constructed according to the mechanical drawing mentioned above, and the wires glued and soldered
to the PC boards attached to the frame.

We agreed that we would design the PC boards and order them for delivery in early November so the chamber could
be assembled then.

Preamplifiers would be designed and fabricated in November, ready for installation and testing in early December.

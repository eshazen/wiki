# MonkeyGripStrength
This is a project to develop an apparatus to measure the finger grip strength of monkeys in the laboratory of Doug Rosene at the BUMC.
The idea is to build a device similar to that described in
[this article](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/RoseneLab/Ohio%20State%20Univ%20-%20Pinch%20Test.pdf)

An original proposal provided in May, 2009 included the following brief description which is still valid:

```
 Two grip measurement devices (for the left and right hands of the subject) will be equipped with
 aluminum tongs attached to strain-gauge type force sensors, and read out using custom
 electronics housed in a small operator console. The console will provide an LCD display and
 operator controls. The peak force exerted by the subject during a trial period will be displayed,
 along with the date and time. A few previous measurements may be stored in memory and
 recalled to the display. A simple computer interface will be provided for optional readout and
 storage of measurements. The entire apparatus will be housed in a Plexiglas box with two
 openings; one for each hand of the subject to reach the aluminum tongs (pinch mechanism)

```
This description is reasonably accurate, except that for cost saving reasons we propose
to omit the date/time display and computer interface unless the additional cost is negligible.

Some further details:

 * Two sensors, right and left will be provided.  They will be standard industrial strain gauges
similar to [this one](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/RoseneLab/207.pdf)
 * A simple display box which displays the maximum force in Newtons, a left/right switch, and a reset button will be provided.
 * A calibration method will be provided to adjust the display output to read accurately in newtons.

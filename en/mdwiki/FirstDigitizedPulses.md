# FirstDigitizedPulses
Hi Eric and Sam,

Here is a link to files that I have saved from the Lecroy Wavesurfer
452 (500MHz 2GS/s).

http://darkmatter.bu.edu/~ainglis/lithiumChamberPulses/

The two directories are as follows:

 * a digitized signal of noise from a single preamp (#1) in a single
channel (#1 - which is just the farthest wire from the summing
amplifier)
 * a series of signal readouts when providing the chamber with test
pulses.  All of these readouts are from the summing amplifier. the
file name format is that it lists the preamplifier used (these are the
second generation preamplifiers - there is a number marked in sharpie
on the upper left corner of each preamplifier), and the wires that
they are placed on respectively (again, wire #1 being the farthest
away from the summing amplifier, then the voltage of the pulse that
was entered.

I realize that this first attempt to pass signal information to you
will probably be riddled with some ambiguities or problems that we
need to get cleared up.  I might need to give you the total
digitization scale for the voltage, although I thought it may be clear
from the numbers how it digitized.  Let''s just take a look at these
and see if there is a better way to pass things over.

Right now we are getting ready for a run of the chamber with HV and an
argon environment, so background, alpha, and neutron-lithium
interactions will be forthcoming.

Thanks,

-Andrew

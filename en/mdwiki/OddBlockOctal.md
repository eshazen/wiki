# OddBlockOctal
This is a page of design notes for my "big" amp, a stereo OddBlock Octal rendition.  See [[http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/TubeAmp/#oddoctal][project page]] for design details.

*2020-11-10* Replaced the JJ KT77's with KT120s.  Still at "63mA" bias setting.  R channel is running more like 70mA and not too stable.  Balance is good, just overall current not too stable.  Also, the LM317HVK get pretty hot.

Power estimate- 45V @ 0.18A would be 8.1W on the LM317.

Thinking of some upgrades:

 * Replace heatsink with maybe these:  HS531-ND (1.8" sq).
 * Add a testpoint on "Out" pin of LM317 to check operation
 * Possibly add a small fan

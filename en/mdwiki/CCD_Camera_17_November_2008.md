# CCD_Camera_17_November_2008
Met with Steve Ahlen, Keith Otis, Hide Tomita, Joe Diaz about CCD camera issues.

*'Current Prototype*

Joe will test the EDF-built camera at MIT next semester to characterize it''s performance.  Joe and Keith will work together (with Guoan if necessary) to get the PC in the lab configured correctly to talk to the camera.

Paul (in EDF) will install the external electronics in a metal box so it is better protected before the camera is moved to MIT.

*'EMCCD Development*

Steve is putting in an ADR proposal (due 12/2) for $50k for each of two years to develop an EMCCD-based camera.  Eric will provide ~ 5 pages of text for this.

We have the following CAEn units that need either 40 or 50 MHz:

WFD (all need 50 MHz driver frequency, I think ECL of some form)
DT5730, 500 MHz, desk top   3-102203-4 connector, LVDS/ECL/PECL/LVPECL (100 ohms ac-coupled)
DT5720, 250 MHz, desk top   (same)
V1724, 16 MHz, VME          (same)
V1720, VME, not sure of frequency  (same)

TDC (needs 50 MHz driver frequency, I think ECL of some form)
V1290N  two 3M 3408-5202  Not clear if Ac- or Dc- coupled

# Miata Information/Links

"All 1990 to 2005 Miatas are 4x100mm bolt pattern"

Summer wheels are KOSEI "Racing" 15x7.0JJ.  Offset probably 38mm but 25mm
seems to be available.  This model seems to be out of production.
Came with Dunlop Direzza ZII 205/50R15.  Slight tire rub at max turn,
not a problem.  Others suggest 195/50 or 195/55.

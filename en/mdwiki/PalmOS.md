# PalmOS
I own a Palm Z22.  Here are some Palm OS software tools
I found useful:

 * [Pyrite Publisher](http://www.pyrite.org/publisher/index.html)
  Convert text or HTML to DOC for reading on the Palm
 * [inDev software](http://indevsoftware.com/)
 a tiny DOC reader application
 * [NthLab](http://www.nthlab.com/)
 calculator.

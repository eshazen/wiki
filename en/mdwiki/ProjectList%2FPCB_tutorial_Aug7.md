# Schematics
 * Net-names, use shared labels when components on schematics are not close together or when drawing a wire would be too messy.
 * Avoid wire cross overs. The fewer the better.
 * Don't run wires over components. Few to no exceptions for this one.
 * Higher voltage at top, lower voltage at bottom.
 * Inputs on left, Outputs on right.
 * Align labels with parts
 * Rotate components

# PCB Layout
 * GND is critical and must be either wide traces or a good plane.
 * Power is next most critical and should have a bypass cap next to each load and should also use heavy traces or planes.
 * Primarily horizontal traces on one layer, primarily vertical traces on other layer.
 * Short traces are better - Frequency of signals?

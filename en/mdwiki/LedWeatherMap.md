Weather map with RGB LEDs for METAR/TAF display
You can get one for $1000 from the first link below, or build one!

Thinking about making my own.  Additional features:

 * Include some airports with no TAF (display METAR/MOS)
 * Control panel:
   * TAF time slider like wx24 pilot app
   * MOS/TAF selector
   * GMT / local clock display (control by slider)

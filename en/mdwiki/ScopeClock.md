# Scope Clocks

* [Ultra-Simple Oscilloscope](https://www.electronixandmore.com/projects/simplescope/index.html) simple CRT power and driver
* [Dutchtronix](http://www.dutchtronix.com) AVR scope clock

Starting a project, apparently.  Ordered a 3BP1 3" CRT with P-3
phosphor on eBay.  Considering to make a new PCB which is a remix of
the Electronixandmore CRT driver and some version of AVR and DACs.
Unlikely to be compatible with the Dutchtronix firmware as the PCF8563
RTC seems unobtainable (though there are breakout boards available).

# Scope Clocks

This is a silly project to develop a CRT clock using mostly vacuum tubes for the analog circuitry.  See [ScopeClockNotes](ScopeClockNotes.md) for other's projects.

Starting a project, apparently.  Ordered a 3BP1 3" CRT with P-3 phosphor on eBay.

Started a PCB based on the "Electronixandmore" design but then started looking more seriously at it and decided to scrap it for now.

Read up on the [Anderson monitor](http://www.taswegian.com/NBTV/forum/viewforum.php?f=17) in the NBTA forum and decided to do something similar.

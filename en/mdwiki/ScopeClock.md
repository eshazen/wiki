# Scope Clocks

* [Ultra-Simple Oscilloscope](https://www.electronixandmore.com/projects/simplescope/index.html) simple CRT power and driver
* [Dutchtronix](http://www.dutchtronix.com) AVR scope clock
* [ClockShield](http://www.dutchtronix.com/Arduino-ClockShield.htm) has AVR source code

Starting a project, apparently.  Ordered a 3BP1 3" CRT with P-3 phosphor on eBay.

Now thinking about a tube-based CRT system.  
The 6BP1 [data sheet](http://www.r-type.org/pdfs/3bp1.pdf) or
[another](http://www.nj7p.org/Tubes/PDFs/Frank/049-RCA_Cuningham/3BP1A.pdf) suggests
between 1500 and 2000V operating voltage.  Maybe a voltage-quadrupler
on a 300V-380V transformer (1700-2200V)?

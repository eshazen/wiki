# ECAL_VFE_Adapter
This page has documentation for a new adapter/readout board being developed for the ECAL phase 2
upgrade for the CMS experiment at CERN.  We have an SVN repository, which currently has only some preliminary documentation
for the original FE board and FE upgrade demonstrator.

This board will be mechanically compatible with the FE board, with connectors for
the new VFE on one side and the FE demonstrator on the other side.  In addition it will
have a generic fiber interface capable of operating up to 10Gb/s for Ethernet or PCIe
control and local readout.

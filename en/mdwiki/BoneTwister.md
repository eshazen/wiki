# BoneTwister
This project is to develop an apparatus to apply torque to sample bones to study their response.
Glenn has tentatively picked out the following items:

 * Driver ($536): https://www.mcmaster.com/6627t62 ([mfgr page](https://www.linengineering.com/products/drivers-controllers/r1025/))
 * Motor ($161): https://www.mcmaster.com/6627t55
 * Torque cell ($535): https://www.omega.com/pptst/TQ301.html

The Driver in principle requires a controller too, as it only has STEP and DIRECTION inputs.
McMaster suggests this one:

 * Controller ($473): https://www.mcmaster.com/6627t68

Omega lists a strain gauge meter with analog output

 * Meter ($375): https://www.omega.com/pptst/dp25b.html
   * (DP25B-S-A model for strain gauges with analog output)

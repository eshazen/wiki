# HVPulser_RevA_Testing_2_25_20
## HIGH VOLTAGE FULL TEST 2/25/20

*Overview:* For this test the voltage input of the Filament Supply was connect to the output of the HV Pulser. In this test the HV Pulser was tested at multiple operating Frequencies: 1kHz, 10kHz,100kHz, 1MHz, 10MHz, and 100MHz. The operating frequency was adjusted by flipping switches tied to clocking cycles on the FPGA.

 *  The 3.3V Regulator IC9 needs to be replaced with a regulator capable of an input voltage greater than 12VDC. If using Texas Instruments LP2950-33LPE3 the part orientation fits the silkscreen outline directly (not turned 90/180 degrees)
 *  Need to take power supply and convert to molex input to PCB
 *  Need to fabricate RCA & Optical connector adapters as part of the enclosure
 *  For optical SPDIF connectors, use 0.1uF ceramic capacitors left over from PCB (5 left) within 1cm of connector body

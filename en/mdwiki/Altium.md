# Altium
### Installation

Obtain a copy of Altium Designer.  Licensing from the EE department currently supports the "Summer 09" release.
You can download it from the EDF server as follows:

 * Connect to network share `\\ohm.bu.edu\public`
 * Navigate to the Altium folder, and download the most recent zip file
 * Extract the zip file, run setup.exe in the setup folder.

When you run the application for the first time, you will need to click the "setup private license server" option,
and enter the information found on [this page](http://collaborate.bu.edu/engit/SoftwareLicensing)
(current server name is *'AltiumLM.bu.edu*, port is *9780*)

You will also need to create an account for yourself on the Altium website and log in.  I don''t remember the
exact details but ask if you need help.  Once you log in you should see a page with a heading *'Available Licenses - Licensed to Boston University*.  Find the heading *Altium Designer Custom Board Implementation, Summer 09* , select one of the lines with available licenses, and then click "Use" to check a license out.

*'Note:* currently we share a small number of licenses with the ECE department in an informal way.  _Please release your license_ when you are not actively using it.

The best documentation I''ve found is on this page:

 * [Getting Started](http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/Getting+Started+with+Altium+Designer)

Find the tutorial "[Getting Started with PCB Design](http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/Tutorial+-+Getting+Started+with+PCB+Design)
and work through it.

# PiZeroW

 * Followed instructions: [here](https://www.losant.com/blog/getting-started-with-the-raspberry-pi-zero-w-without-a-monitor).
Worked perfectly, now boots, connects to WiFi and allows ssh to 'pi' username (Chinese PW).
 * C++ interface for GPIO here [page](http://hertaville.com/introduction-to-accessing-the-raspberry-pis-gpio-in-c.html) and [git](https://github.com/halherta/RaspberryPi-GPIOClass-v2)
 * pigpio looks more promising [link](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html)

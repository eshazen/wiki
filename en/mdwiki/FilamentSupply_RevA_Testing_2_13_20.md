# FilamentSupply_RevA_Testing_2_13_20
## LOW VOLTAGE FULL TEST 2/13/20

*Overview:* For this test the voltage input of the Filament Supply was connect to the output of the LV Mixer. In this test the LV Mixer was tested at multiple operating Frequencies: 1kHz, 10kHz,100kHz, 1MHz, 10MHz, and 100MHz. The operating frequency was adjusted by flipping switches tied to clocking cycles on the FPGA.

# YAG_Timing_Box
Please see [this page](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/YagBox/)
of YaG laser timing boxes built for the lab of Amy Mullen (now
at the University of Maryland).

This page describes a Rev 3 all-digital timing controller for a YAG laser
used for photochemistry experiments (which was never built).

This design is based on the Xilinx/Digilent
[Spartan-3 Development Board](http://www.digilentinc.com/info/S3Board.cfm)
A simple [interface_board](interface_board.md)
Laser is also needed.

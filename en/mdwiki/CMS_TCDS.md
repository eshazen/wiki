# CMS_TCDS
The CERN TCDS (Trigger, Controls Distribution System) consists of three different module types built on the FC-7 double-with MicroTCA module with two FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card) modules.

Technical documentation for the boards may be found in the CERN EDMS system:

 * [FMC with 8 SFP](https://edms.cern.ch/project/EDA-02707)
 * [FMC with 2 SFP+LEMOs](https://edms.cern.ch/project/EDA-02708)
 * [FMC with 4 SFP+RJ45s](https://edms.cern.ch/project/EDA-02727)
 * [GLIB module](https://edms.cern.ch/project/EDA-02180) (older MicroTCA carrier for prototyping/tests)
 * [FC7](https://edms.cern.ch/nav/P:CERN-0000153765:V0/P:CERN-0000153766:V0) MicroTCA carrier

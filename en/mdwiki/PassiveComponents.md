## Some interesting notes on passive components

 * ["Technical Update -- Ceramic vs Tantalum Capacitors"](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/DataSheets/Passives/2008-11%20Update%20-%20Ceramic%20versus%20Tantalum.pdf) -- interesting note from Kemet, 2008
 * ["Why do they even make tantalum capacitors"](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/DataSheets/Passives/News_%20Why%20Do%20They%20Even%20Make%20Tantalum%20Capacitors_%20_%20element14.pdf) -- note from Element 14 website
 * ["Ceramic Capacitors replace Tantalum Capacitors in LDOs"](http://ohm.bu.edu/~hazen/DataSheets/Passives/slva214a.pdf) -- Note from TI.  This points out that sometimes ESR must be inserted externally when substituting a ceramic

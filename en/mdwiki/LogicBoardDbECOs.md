## V 1.0

 * *DONE-BOM* Update nine 0805 0.1 ohm resistors to correctly be 0805 and not 0805 wide (BOM)
 * *DONE-SCH-BOM* Swap 0.1 ohm resistor for 1.4 V monitoring for 0.05 ohm one
 * *DONE-SCH-BOM* Swap R41 for 3k resistor. (BOM)
 * *DONE-SCH-PCB-BOM* Add 1uF capacitors on all current monitor voltage dividers (ten in total)
 * *DONE-SCH* Update reset signal to correctly be not reset (just the name was wrong, called reset, but it was n_reset)
 * *DONE-SCH-PCB-BOM* Add 10 nF capacitor across R50
 * *DONE-SCH-PCB-BOM* Fix DS18B20U ground pin
 * *DONE-SCH-BOM* 1.4V regulator resistors to R27 = 1.8M and R25 = 300k

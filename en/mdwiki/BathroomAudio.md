# BathroomAudio
Would like to have (bluetooth?) sound in bathroom.  Sara wants no holes in wall or other ugly stuff.

Ideas:

 * Build an amp based on e.g. LM1875
   * Mount in (double?) wall box with bluetooth module (need access to bluetooth button though)
     * start with surface mount box, with wall wart plugged into outlet
   * Wires to attic
   * Power from where?
 * Minimus-7 white speakers on wall brackets, with wires to attic

## LM1875

* (Datasheet)[https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm1875.pdf]
* (post about power)[https://linustechtips.com/topic/1134138-lm1875-power-supply/]
* (AS-1218)[https://www.antekinc.com/content/AS-1218.pdf] tansformer... 100VA 2x18V
* (many kits)[https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313&_nkw=LM1875+kit&_sacat=0] available

Power estimate for +/-25V supply is about 16W maximum, so a good heatink is needed.  See datasheet.

# BathroomAudio
Would like to have (bluetooth?) sound in bathroom.  Sara wants no holes in wall or other ugly stuff.

Ideas:

 * Build an amp based on e.g. https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/TPA3122D2N/1841855
   * Mount in (double?) wall box with bluetooth module (need access to bluetooth button though)
     * start with surface mount box, with wall wart plugged into outlet
   * Wires to attic
   * Power from where?
 * Minimus-7 white speakers on wall brackets, with wires to attic

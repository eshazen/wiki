# BathroomAudio

Built a nice tube amp [github](https://github.com/eshazen/6cy7-amp).

Now, would like to have a box with a built-in spotify player plus a
radio.  For the spotify player, an R-Pi seems like a good bet.

See [raspberrypitips](https://raspberrytips.com/play-spotify-on-raspberry-pi/)

Volumio seems like a reasonable choice.
Can do it by just spending $$$.

| UGREEN USB DAC                   |   $9.99 |       |

I do already have a 3B and 3B+.  Need to check their RAM.
Also may need a WiFi dongle e.g. [this](https://a.co/d/2M13Mgn) or
[this](https://a.co/d/3fbPpnb).

My 3B seems to have only 1GB but I got volumio running and streaming
from spotify.  But, there's no GUI on it.  **Maybe** if I bought a
touch screen for $80 and installed the plugin it would work?  Or maybe
it would need more than 1GB of RAM?

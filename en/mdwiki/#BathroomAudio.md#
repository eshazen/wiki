# BathroomAudio
Would like to have (bluetooth?) sound in bathroom.  Sara wants no holes in wall or other ugly stuff.

Ideas:

 * Build an amp based on e.g. https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/TPA3122D2N/1841855
 or maybe better LM1875 (20W).  See e.g. [this post](https://www.circuitbasics.com/audio-amplifiers/)
 * To just get it done, should just order 2X "LM1875 Kit" from eBay
   * Mount in (double?) wall box with bluetooth module (need access to bluetooth button though)
     * start with surface mount box, with wall wart plugged into outlet
   * Wires to attic
   * Power from where?
 * Minimus-7 white speakers on wall brackets, with wires to attic

## LM1875

Power supply suggestion from (this post)[https://diyaudioprojects.com/Chip/DIY-TDA2050-Hi-Fi-Chip-Amplifier/].

# BabyMobile
This page describes electronics for an experiment in infant learning
conducted by Dr. Linda Fetters and her group in the Sargent College.

A musical mobile is suspended over a table where an infant subject
lies on it''s back.  A plastic target equipped with a micro-switch
trigger is placed above the infant''s feet.  When the target is
kicked, the mobile is activated for a short period.

Decided to go with Spartan-3E eval board using SiTCP firmware.
Wu is going to provide "big fifo" SDRAM firmware.

Have compiled latest version of SiTCP from Wu into a test firmware
which sends a counter as TCP data.  It seems to work fine.

Current Xilinx project is in *'~hazen/Projects/AhlenCCD/ccd2*
on joule, test program for readout is in *'~hazen/AhlenCCD* on
volta.

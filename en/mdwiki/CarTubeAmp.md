# CarTubeAmp

How about a tube amp for the car?  There are a few challenges:

 * Mechanical robustness
 * Cooling / extreme temperature range
 * Power supply (need to boost everything from 12V)
 * Output power (need a lot of watts for good car sound)

First experiment to do:

Try to power the tube boom box using the red inverter, to get an idea if that thing is even in the ballpark for power output.

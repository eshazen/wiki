## Battery Connection Terminal

## Discharge Timer

This device provides a 5-second controlled discharge for a custom battery
when triggered by a pushbutton.  The maximum current is 100mA.  The discharge
circuit is to be isolated from the power source.  Power from AA batteries is acceptable.

The would like one prototype in one week (by 5/7/12) and potentially 4 more units later.
We agree that the first prototype would be hand-wired in an aluminum Bud box.

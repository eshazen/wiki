## TOF meeting 2019-09-17

Present:  M. El-Batanouny, George, Siwei, Mike K.

Reviewed both systems.

### Regular Helium Scattering

Custom electronics needed:

 * TOF box
 * Preamp / discriminator for MCP (multi-channel plate) pulse input
 * 3A floating constant-current supply for e-gun filament
 * Low Voltage "pulser" (mixer)

Off-the-shelf electronics:

 * 0 to 400V supply
 * 0 to -25V supply
 * 0 to 20V supply

The Filament supply and LV pulser should be fairly close to the e-gun feedthrough.

The Preamp may need to be near the MCP electronics depending on signal levels

### Metastable Helium Experiment

Custom electronics needed:

 * TOF box (only pulse output used)
 * Exciter power supply (can be same as e-gun filament supply?)
 * HV pulser

Off-the-shelf electronics:

 * -200V supply (could be the 0-400V from regular experiment)
 * Solenoid power supply

### Homework

 * find the LV pulser schematic
 * signal characteristics of the MCP output

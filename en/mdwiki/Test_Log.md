_'27 April 2007 (hazen)_

Testing 2nd board.  Trying to reproduce strange behavior seen in MIT tests
(see
[scope traces](http://joule.bu.edu/~hazen/DRIFT/Testing/23Apr2007_MIT/)
I suspect there is either a problem with their power supplies,
or a component has come loose on their board.

Meanwhile, with the 2nd board, we see much cleaner output (see
[scope traces](http://joule.bu.edu/~hazen/DRIFT/Testing/27Apr2007_BU_1.pdf)
